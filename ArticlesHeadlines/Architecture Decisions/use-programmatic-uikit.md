#  UIKit for Programmatic Views
---

### Status
Initial implementation.

### Context
The initial default way of implementing the view for the entire app.

### Decision
The requirements include UIKit as the default way of implementing reusable views, without the use of storyboards. Everything can be maintained in code and can be refactored more easily. This also makes code history more readable.

### Consequences
This slows down the time for developing even basic UI components.
